# <Prework Study Guide Application>

## Description

Originally prompted by my Bootcamp, the process of creating a study guide by using skills that are being taught is an excellent way to learn the basic fundamentals of what goes into a webpage while at the same time having a reference sheet for future use. This method provides a convenient way to learn the content provided while practicing them through repetition. The most valuable skill that has been learned so far from this project is the usage of Git Bash and executing the Git Flow on GitHub.
